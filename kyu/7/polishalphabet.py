# There are 32 letters in the Polish alphabet: 9 vowels and 23 consonants.

# Your task is to change the letters with diacritics:

# ą -> a,
# ć -> c,
# ę -> e,
# ł -> l,
# ń -> n,
# ó -> o,
# ś -> s,
# ź -> z,
# ż -> z
# and print out the string without the use of the Polish letters.

# For example:

# "Jędrzej Błądziński"  -->  "Jedrzej Bladzinski"
# #My solution:

    replacements = {
        "ą": "a", "ć": "c", "ę": "e", "ł": "l", "ń": "n",
        "ó": "o", "ś": "s", "ź": "z", "ż": "z"
    }
    for old, new in replacements.items():
        st = st.replace(old, new)
    return st
